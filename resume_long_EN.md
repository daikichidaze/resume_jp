## EXPERIENCED PROJECTS
Explanations of projects which I have experienced in the past are shown below.

### 1.Establishment of a new business planning function
- Establishing a new business planning function from the conceptual stage that the company previously did not have.
- Each member was working separately on the Feasibility study project (FS).
  - It was not possible to evaluate each new business project, and it had become a passive activity.
- I established a common framework and promoted it within the department in order to drive the new business forward.
- In addition, I suggested the need for a business planning function in response to the situation that involved working only on FS. After that I worked extensively as a company-wide planning function.

### 2.Lanch a productivity improvement consulting service for automotive R&D designers
- Lead the launch of a productivity consulting service as a strategic new business for an existing division of an automotive R&D client.
  - It was a challenge for the existing business units to have a deep understanding of the designer's process.
  - As a response to this, I provided an integrated service from hearing to tool development to improve business efficiency.
  - In particular, the team was able to break through the barriers that have prevented them from launching the original service. (~ 5 million THB / year)
- I led everything from early-stage business planning, actual service works and launch the tool development team.
  - I set up our own software development team, especially in a situation with limited experience in the development.
  - This project has become an achievement that leads to the planning of company-wide application business strategies.

### 3.Pre-study of new MaaS services
- Development of a simulator to validate service concepts in a virtual world on a computer in order to study new service requirements that do not exist in the world.
- Worked in a wide range of roles as a project leader
  - Pre-sales and basic design
  - Requirement definition and system design
  - Mathematical optimization algorithm and simulator development
    - Planning of an operation schedule through combination optimization
    - Development of a heuristic carpooling algorithm
  - Simulation execution and data analysis of the calculation result
    - Consideration of simulation conditions
    - Analysis report creation
  - Project management in the above process
